#INTRODUCTION
A Flutter-based application is developed to enable real-time remote health monitoring using IoT devices to
remote/rural areas with lack of accessibility to healthcare or proper ECG systems. The system focuses on
constant monitoring and early diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions by comparing real-time patient data with
baseline values. Itis specifically designed for remote and underserved regions to enhance healthcare
accessibility and efficiency.

SCOPE
The Remote Patient Health Monitoring Application is designed to provide continuous real-time health monitoring
using IoT-based wearable sensors. The system collects and analyzes vital health parameters such as heart
rate, oxygen saturation (SpOâ‚‚), ECG, and body temperature. The data is processed and stored securely using
Firebase, and the mobile application (developed using Flutter) allows patients, doctors, and caregivers to access
real-time health insights.

ABOUT MEDUINO
Our goal was to develop a accessible, cheap and
easy to use medical care interface that provides
patients from underserved areas access to quality
medical care with regard to abnormal
cardiovascular symptoms and rapid retrieval and
access of such health diagnostic information to the
nearest available medical facility. This helps make
healthcare more accessible and cheap in rural
areas.

FEATURES:
Remote Monitoring to detect health
abnormalities
Patient data access: Access Patient data
after authentication.
Patient Data Collection for Future access
Baseline Analysis: Comparison of real-time
data with predefined normal values for
cardiovascular health
User-Friendly Interface
